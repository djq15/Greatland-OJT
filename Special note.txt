** My XAMPP configuration is catered towards using gmail to send verification email to registration requests and is using my
gmail account credentials.

** Please manually change "verified" under login table in MySQL db to "1" to simulate verifying of email

** I also configured my XAMPP to not show syntax warnings on the html page 

** Please refer to injection/connectionTest.php for authentication to MySQL database
(I have set password to "IETI19" and db to "birthright_db"
